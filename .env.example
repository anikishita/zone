# Gemini API Key - Server-Side Only (Secure)
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# This API key is kept secure on the server and never exposed to clients

# For Vercel deployment:
# Project Settings > Environment Variables > Add new
# Name: GEMINI_API_KEY (no VITE_ prefix - this is server-side only)
# Value: your_api_key_here
# Apply to: Production, Preview, and Development

# The chatbot uses a serverless function at /api/chat to proxy requests
# This keeps your API key completely hidden from client-side code
